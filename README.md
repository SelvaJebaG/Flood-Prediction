# Flood-Prediction
Import libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, tensorflow, keras, sklearn.
Data preprocessing
- Load the time series data.
- Handle missing values: Interpolate or impute missing values.
- Check for stationarity: Perform tests like ADF test to check stationarity.
Split data
-Split the dataset into training and testing sets such as 80% for training and 20% for testing.
Normalize data
-Normalize the data to ensure all features are on a similar scale. Min-max scaling is commonly used.
Define model architecture
-Design the Conv1D-SBiGRU architecture using TensorFlow.
-Use a sequential model
-Define input layer, Conv1D layer, Bidirectional GRU layers, dense layers, flatten layer.
•	Input layer: Input shape is (batch size, time steps, features) where: batch size is the number of samples in each batch, time steps is the number of time steps in the input sequence, features is the number of features in each time step.
•	Conv1D layer: Parameters - Number of filters, Kernel size, Padding, Activation function.
•	Bidirectional GRU layers: Parameters - Number of units, Activation function, Return sequences.
•	Dense layer: Parameters - Number of units, Activation function
Compile model
-Compile the model by specifying the loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics.
-Choose appropriate loss function and optimizer.
Train model
-Fit the model to the training data.
-Specify batch size and number of epochs for training.
Evaluate model
-Evaluate the model performance on the test dataset.
-Compute metrics such as mean absolute error, root mean squared error, R-squared and accuracy.
Estimate RDI
-Calculate RDI percentage from the predicted rainfall value and the normal value specified by IMD for specific region.
Visualize results against real-world events
-Visualize predicted flood occurrences against real-world events to assess model performance.
Note:
Adjustments to the architecture and hyperparameters can be made based on the specific characteristics of the dataset, availability of the data and the requirements of the forecasting task.
